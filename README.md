# Bitewise

This repository contains the project files for an interactive Shiny app developed as part of the **Data Visualization Techniques** course at Warsaw University of Technology during the 2024/2025 winter semester. The app helps visualize personal dietary data, offering insights into eating habits through interactive charts and tools. The data was collected over a 3-week period using the **Fitatu** app. The app is hosted at: [https://olazaw.shinyapps.io/proj2/](https://olazaw.shinyapps.io/proj2/).

**Creators:** [Paula Wołkowska](https://github.com/pwolkowska), [Alicja Przeździecka](https://github.com/aprzezdziecka), [Aleksandra Zawadka](https://github.com/Ola-zaw).
